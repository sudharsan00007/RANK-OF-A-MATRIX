# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm:
Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

Step 2:
Prepare the lists from each equation and assign in np.array

Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
Step 4:
end the program

## Program:
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
import numpy as np
A =  [[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]
B = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(B)
